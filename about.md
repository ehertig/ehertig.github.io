Hello! I am Emilie Hertig, a final-year PhD student in Astronomy at the University of Cambridge. I am fascinated by the most fundamental questions in cosmology such as the nature of space and time, the birth of the Universe and the cause of its current accelerated expansion. My various projects span a broad range of topics, but share a common goal of combining theoretical insight with advanced numerical simulation and data analysis methods.

I completed her bachelor’s and master’s degrees at EPFL, in my native Switzerland, specializing in theoretical physics. My first research project, carried out during an exchange year in Vancouver (Canada), focused on measuring the expansion rate of the Universe to shed light on dark energy. My master’s thesis consisted of searching for extensions of General Relativity in gravitational wave signals. In Cambridge, I am conducting research at the interface of cosmology and quantum field theory, in a multidisciplinary effort to unveil cosmic origins.
